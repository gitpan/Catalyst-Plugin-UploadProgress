=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Plugin::UploadProgress - Realtime file upload information

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Catalyst;
    MyApp->setup( qw/Static::Simple Cache::FastMmap UploadProgress/ );

    # On the HTML page with the upload form, include the progress
    # JavaScript and CSS.  These are available via a single method
    # if you are lazy.
    <html>
      <head>
        [% c.upload_progress_javascript %]
      </head>
      ...

    # For better performance, copy these 3 files from the UploadProgress
    # distribution to your static directory and include them normally.
    <html>
      <head>
        <link href="/static/css/progress.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
        <script src="/static/js/progress.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="/static/js/progress.jmpl.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
      </head>
      ...

    # Create the upload form with an onsubmit action that creates
    # the Ajax progress bar.  Note the empty div following the form
    # where the progress bar will be inserted.
    <form action='/upload'
          method="post"
          enctype="multipart/form-data"
          onsubmit="return startEmbeddedProgressBar(this)">
  
      <input type="file" name="file" />
      <input type="submit" />
    </form>
    <div id='progress'></div>

    # No special code is required within your application, just handle
    # the upload as usual.
    sub upload : Local {
        my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

        my $upload = $c->request->uploads->{file};
        $upload->copy_to( '/some/path/' . $upload->filename );
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin is a simple, transparent method for displaying a
progress bar during file uploads.

=head1 DEMO

Please see the example/Upload directory in the distribution for a working
example Catalyst application with upload progress.  Since Upload Progress
requires 2 concurrent connections (one for the upload and one for the
Ajax, you will need to use either script/upload_poe.pl (which requires
L<Catalyst::Engine::HTTP::POE> >= 0.02) or script/upload_server.pl -f.  
The -f enables forking for each new request.

=head1 ENGINE SUPPORT

The included demo application has been tested and is known to work on
the following setups with Catalyst 5.7003:

C::E::HTTP (server.pl) with -f flag (OSX)
C::E::HTTP::POE 0.06 (OSX)
C::E::Apache2::MP20 1.07 with Apache 2.0.58, mod_perl 2.0.2 (OSX)
C::E::FastCGI with Apache 2.0.55, mod_fastcgi 2.4.2 (Ubuntu)

=head1 INTERNAL METHODS

You don't need to know about these methods, but they are documented
here for developers.

=head2 upload_progress( $progress_id )

Returns the data structure associated with the given progress ID.
Currently the data is a hashref with the total size of the upload
and the amount of bytes received so far.

    {
        size     => 110636659,
        received => 134983
    }

=head2 upload_progress_output

Returns a JSON response containing the upload progress data.

=head2 upload_progress_javascript

Inlines the necessary JavaScript and CSS code into your page.  For better
performance, you should copy the files into your application as displayed
above in the Synopsis.

=head1 EXTENDED METHODS

=head2 prepare_body ( $c )

Detects if the user aborted the upload.

=head2 prepare_body_chunk ( $chunk )

Takes each chunk of incoming upload data and updates the upload progress
record with new information.

=head2 dispatch

Watches for a URI ending with '?progress_id=<id>' and returns the
JSON output from C</upload_progress_output>.
